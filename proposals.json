The current proposal system works well for ideas, start-ups and projects but is less suited to fund facilitators, connectors, documenters, mentors, researchers and other community service oriented activities. For this reason we need to experiment with alternative forms of challenges.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Format:\n\nEach proposer signs up for the same commitment:\n\n6 months, minimum of 8 hours community service activities per week.\n\nEach proposer will be rewarded 2000$ per month (12000 total)\n\n  \n\n\nReasoning:\n\nIf the budget per proposer is fixed this ensures that a total of 25 System Innovators will be funded in this challenge. This also removes any competition between proposers in price. Furthermore, by limiting the parameters, comparing between proposals and results is more straightforward. The commitment is not full-time to make this a gradual transition, and as most candidates have ongoing commitments in Catalyst.\n\n  \n\n\nWho are System Innovators?\n\nA system innovator is someone who:\n\n* Seeks to coordinate and connect\n* works across boundaries\n* Looks for emergence\n* Embraces complexity\n* Thinks holistically\n* Innovates\n\n  \n\n\nThe cohort should collaborate among each other and are encouraged to form loose groups. A common discord server will be set up by the challenge team and used as a way to stay connected. The work being done should be shared publicly and transparently.\n\n  \n\n\nHow to propose:\n\n  \n\n\nMust be a single proposer, no co-proposers.\n\nMust ask for 12.000$ and agree to the time commitment \n\nMust commit to work open and transparently\n\n  \n\n\nThe proposal should focus on\n\n* motivation\n* previous engagement in Catalyst\n* connections with other proposers\n* area of focus\n* examples of activities\n\n  \n\n\nProposers are encouraged to reference other proposers to show intent to collaborate.\n\nProposers are expected to be engaged in Catalyst in other ways and roles.\n\n  \n\n\nProposals that do not fit these requirements should get a rating of 1.\n\n","proposal_importance":"If we only focus on creating solutions, sometimes together, no one is focussing on *how* *we get better at* solving problems together, always\n\n","proposal_goal":"A network of Systems Innovators is formed who bring the community together in various constructive ways which lead to tangible outcomes\n\n","proposal_metrics":"Increased sense of community, more collaboration and idea sharing outside of Ideascale.\n\nContinued engagement and collaboration among the cohort members\n\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":1,"proposal_id":"405488","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Cardano on Social Media","proposal_summary":"How can Cardano leverage social media to reach people that are new to the Blockchain world?\n\n","proposal_public_key":"d1tKJWH3BqM8/KYtPsg7fZqKFf7BHxNIV9byKRzhDto=","proposal_funds":500000,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBw8V","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":267,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"Nebiyu","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"","proposer_relevant_experience":""},"chain_proposal_id":"e3476ae2fddd4600daa94ea4c963284f78405751a70758e5d3efc9a2bdcf4b0c","chain_proposal_index":1,"chain_vote_options":{"no":1,"yes":0},"chain_voteplan_id":"70e2b486cf7d85ed87e27b40e3a517bd537b564ef3f4a322e2275c17f595dbb9","chain_vote_start_time":"2022-08-11T09:00:00Z","chain_vote_end_time":"2022-08-25T13:00:00Z","chain_committee_end_time":"2022-09-04T13:00:00Z","chain_voteplan_payload":"private","chain_vote_encryption_key":"ristretto255_votepk14mj3stqk8kn4ywx3glajrqv0w3f7dpgxd7zev4le995calxwya5smrge3j","fund_id":8,"challenge_id":23,"reviews_count":3,"proposal_brief":"According to the latest report on cryptocurrencies by the US government, it has put the number of people with any kind of cryptocurrency at 16% of the US population.

These projects are reaching the point where they are mature enough for people to deploy using them or build tooling for them and so it's time to start welcoming projects to Cardano.\n\nYou can hear Charles talk about the importance of this in his video \"The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8a6tX53YPs)\n\n","proposal_importance":"Many projects are stuck on EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum and are looking for an escape.

Moreover*, there is no *common infrastructure* that the projects can use to *track issues*, and *publish* basic *public information* about the *projects funded by the community*.\n\n  \n\n\nWe are of the advise that *we need a set of standards, processes, and infrastructures to be used by the Cardano open source projects*, such that (1) The teams of different O.S. projects can easily *collaborate*; (2) New-joiners can easily *discover*, *understand*, *test*, and *contribute* to existing O.S. projects; (3) Cardano O.S. projects can access a pool of basic *infrastructures* and *tools* that are needed.\n\n  \n\n\nMotivation\n\n  \n\n\nAs mentioned by Charles Hoskinson [1] \"Cardano code is Open Source, but needs to be managed like a true open source project, like Linux and other O.S. projects [..]\". \n\n  \n\n\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T88\\_XKzi8ms&t=492s\n\n  \n\n\nIn order to proceed in this direction, we need to use *Catalyst as a governance over a true, vendor-neutral open source and open-standards ecosystem*. To achieve that, we are missing processes (e.g. how the project teams should behave and participate in the ecosystem), and infrastructures (e.g. VCS, CMS, Wiki, Forum, etc.)\n\n  \n\n\nGuiding questions:\n\n  \n\n\n* How can we guide the growth of a vendor neutral ecosystem?\n* How can we build a common identity and increase awareness on Cardano projects?\n* How can we increase the discoverability and the commercial adoption of our projects?\n* How can we increase the degree of collaboration across different projects?\n* How can we lower the barriers and increase open participation to our ecosystem?\n* How can we provide equal opportunities to all projects no matter the size?\n\n  \n\n\nPossible directions:\n\n  \n\n\n* Incentivize collaboration across projects to solve complex problems\n* Introduce common standards and processes and incentivize their adoption across projects\n* Provide cross-project infrastructures and tools needed to co-ordinate\n* Ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base\n* Support a network of professional technology ambassadors\n\n  \n\n\nNote\n\n  \n\n\nThis challenge builds on top of the existing *F8 Open Standards & Interoperability* and is loosely related to *F9 OSDE Open Source Dev Ecosystem* (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/401296).\n\n  \n\n\n*Shortly said*: This challenge (OSI) is about Openness, standardization, and interoperability across open source projects funded by the community, while the \"open source\" (*OSDE*) one is about increasing the number/quality of projects.\n\n  \n\n\nReferences\n\n  \n\n\n[OPSTD] Almeida, Fernando & José, Oliveira & José, Cruz.

On the long term, all of the community-funded projects should be open and transparent by following common standards.\n* There should be observable improvements: easier to discover projects and find project resources, more intuitive to access project knowledge base (documentation, how-to, etc.), and simple to find and contact project members.\n* It should be possible to have project synergies by allowing simple inter-project communication, knowledge sharing, and re-use of existing components/services.\n* We should observe an increase in open-source contributions to different projects: both from new joiners and from other people already in the Cardano community\n* We should observe an increase in reputability of the Cardano Open Source projects. The measure can be done by looking at media communications of various open source communities.\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":139,"proposal_id":"404984","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"NFT Bids - Powered by Balou","proposal_summary":"NFTs are difficult to buy/sell after the initial drop, building trust between the buyer and seller is critical in developing the ecosystem. \n\n","proposal_public_key":"sT6dEJwldHZmCzNWfgLXDdTLqVQa//3zl5l6EkBgSnQ=","proposal_funds":20000,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBw0F","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":333,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"adrien.cirou","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"https://www.balouapp.com","proposer_relevant_experience":"Adrien Cirou: CEO Balou - 15+ yrs Business Development and Marketing\n\nMichele Pires: 10+ yrs UX/UI Designer, PgM\n\nTravis Yatsko: COO Balou -  6+ yrs SWE, SPO, TPM\n\nTanner Cox: 10+ yrs Senior SWE\n\n"},"chain_proposal_id":"fa727ce1bc2d0d1fc9d6db856db30201b09132239a109f726af5ad08c11a94ec","chain_proposal_index":25,"chain_vote_options":{"yes":0,"no":1},"chain_voteplan_id":"286077568d430a2cf7177a8c2e45fc182ee75043101b6fcaf76679ccf5915a38","chain_vote_start_time":"2022-08-11T09:00:00Z","chain_vote_end_time":"2022-08-25T13:00:00Z","chain_committee_end_time":"2022-09-04T13:00:00Z","chain_voteplan_payload":"private","chain_vote_encryption_key":"ristretto255_votepk1q6wly9lc55ms2snz60w6q86t22uwr2876l09cajs3yuj8h0q9sdsdwz7rc","fund_id":8,"challenge_id":6,"reviews_count":5,"proposal_solution":"An iOS and Android application allowing users to buy/sell NFTs in an auction format with an escrow service protecting the transaction.\n\n","challenge_type":"simple"},{"internal_id":140,"proposal_id":"404976","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Blace.io: Marketplace Creator ?","proposal_summary":"As marketplaces are being built, repeat work is being executed, cutting into the overall efficiency of developers.\n\n","proposal_public_key":"2t+0j6c0I0YkoOQ57JC3esmK3pwr1HLDeR2UDWk0sQM=","proposal_funds":96200,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBwz7","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":478,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"Victor Corcino","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"https://loxeinc.com/","proposer_relevant_experience":"Loxe Inc.

And although one could say that the responsibility falls solely on the hands of governmental groups, at times its necessary for people to step up and together become the catalysts and drivers of solutions.\n\n  \n\n\nNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. - Margaret Mead\n\n  \n\n\nThis challenge is set out to find new educational methodologies, solutions, shifting current educational paradigms, providing more international inclusiveness and more importantly, to show how Cardanos technology can really truly make an impact at the root level of many developing nations: Education.\n\n  \n\n\n? To CAs and Voters:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Check that a proposal does not exceed more than 15% of the total Challenge Budget\n2. Give bonus/cookie points to proposers showing collaborative traits with other proposers\n3. Ensure that proposals account for infrastructure concerns, and local needs\n\n  \n\n\n? To Proposers:\n\n  \n\n\n* Translations aside. In developing regions, how can we best educate people about Cardanos technology?\n* How can Cardanos technology and/or the tooling being built around it be used to create innovative educational initiatives in developing regions?\n* The field of blockchain for education opened the door for new areas of research; how can we best explore the field and come up with new useful data for the ecosystems?\n* How can we accelerate the onboarding of traditional developers into Cardanos Blockchain technology?\n* How can we get academia (Universities, Colleges, and Polytechnics) to assist with the education, and adoption of the technology?\n* What are some lobbying strategies people could use to introduce Cardano to the broad international community?\n* How can we bring educational information to people who normally do not have access to the content?\n\n  \n\n\n? DO\n\n  \n\n\nThink of solutions that will generate excitement amongst the people you aim to onboard. Examples could be hackathons, interactive/networking seminars, technical formation centers aimed towards Haskell/Plutus skills, Cardano 101 sessions, media content, and more!\n\n \n\nSeek collaborations with other Catalyst-grown projects that are currently building in the educational space.\n\n \n\nBuild educational applications, platforms, and/or marketing plans to help boost education using the technology.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n? DONT\n\n  \n\n\nFocus solely on translating material. Although its still needed and proposals are welcomed; know that for education to have a better measurable impact, translations should be paired with good methodologies for digesting and teaching the content to new individuals.\n\n \n\nExpect results in extremely short time frames. Know that educational processes can take some time, and that is okay. I know we all have a thirst to see technology spread like wildfire, but people learn at different paces and the technology is still a bit young, so implementing paced methodologies is probably a good idea.\n\n","proposal_importance":"Unequal access to education is a problem affecting many regions.

To encourage this adoption, the tools built by the community will need clean, usable, understandable experiences that users without technical expertise can embrace and implement to add value for themselves. This challenge provides funding to directly address user experiences on Cardano.\n\n  \n\n\nThree \"E's\"\n\n  \n\n\nThe overarching goal of this challenge is to promote the three \"E's\" that will help to grow a non-technical user base on Cardano. New tools should Entertain, Educate, and/or Excite new users to adopt the technology. Much like social media was the \"killer\" app that further connected users to each other, we must seek out the new experiences that users will add to their lives because it makes their lives better. This time, we'll do it without the other E: Exploitation.\n\n  \n\n\nUsability Metrics\n\n  \n\n\nProjects should build their interfaces with focus on ensuring ease of task completion. A user should want to grab this tool to solve the problem that they are experiencing, because the tool is easy to use and allows the user to complete their task. \n\n  \n\n\nEngagement Metrics\n\n  \n\n\nProjects that embrace these metrics need to ensure that the user is there because they want to be there, not because they are locked in to the experience. Agency is important. Success in this metric could also show a reduction in engagement, if it means the user is improving their overall experience.\n\n  \n\n\nConversion Metrics\n\n  \n\n\nUsers will share tools that improve their experience. Projects that embrace these metrics should focus on improvements that users want to recommend to their peers. \n\n  \n\n\n","proposal_importance":"The future of blockchain tech is building out the experiences that users want in their lives, while leaving them in control of their info.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Experiences are built that draw a new user base that takes advantage of the underlying technology, while providing value in their lives.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"The three core metrics of User Experience (UX) are usability, engagement, and conversion.

The first sentence at Cardano.org is making the world work better for all and you can see this line in practically every video of Mr. Charles Hoskinson as well as many of the Cardano ecosystem activities.\n\n \n\nFollowing fund 6 we have conducted the research matching Catalyst proposals with SDGs and the results were very promising. This research showed that 27.5% of the funded proposals directly connect to impact the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and 68.5% indirectly connect to impact the SDGs. This is not a surprise as blockchain technology has the potential to have an impact on financial inclusion, governance, education, and other areas which comply with SDGs objectives. \n\n  \n\n\nImpact-driven businesses (or the transformation of the business to have a greater societal impact) are a major business strategy today. It has become a norm for large corporations, multinationals, and many small and medium-sized enterprises to have Social and environmental focused departments, with such focus growing in importance for many stakeholders. \n\n \n\nMany corporate financial reports show this growing trend. An example is Nestles 2020 annual financial report (the summary already includes some key relevant information), which highlights that Nestles internal stakeholders see climate and decarbonization, innovative business models, and digital technology as having a major impact on Nestles success: https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-03/2020-annual-review-en.pdf\n\n \n\nThis is a huge opportunity for Cardano to maintain its leadership in philosophy, technology, and initiatives that support the growing number of government projects, investor sentiment, and company initiatives aiming to make this world better for all. \n\n  \n\n\nUnited Nations India says A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society.\n\n  \n\n\nCollaboration and partnerships are key to achieving the SDGs by 2030. It is the avenue by which we co-produce impactful solutions to wicked problems. Creating a space for these collaborations to take place, and designing a new framework to receive qualified leads, will help the global society work towards the successful implementation of the sustainable development agenda which is so critical to our continued thriving on this planet.\n\n \n\nTo that end, this proposal is being submitted by many of the existing Cardano and Project Catalyst community impact networks who are coming together to form the Cardano Impact Collective.

They help to prevent duplicate challenge settings, remove challenges created by self interest, reduce the need for deep knowledge of the ecosystem from challenge proposal teams and also removes an easy entry point for malicious actors.\n\n  \n\n\nThe full documentation for Catalyst Funding Categories can be found here: https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories\n\n  \n\n\n7 funding categories have been documented to cover all forms of ideas and proposals. All proposals can be found here - https://linktr.ee/cardanopace\n\n  \n\n\nThe budget weighting for the 7 categories has been determined using a community governance process.

This provides a less competitive environment for teams to find initial funding to nurture their growth and evolution.\n\n  \n\n\nThis category can be seen as an on ramp for new ideas and teams for trying things out something and showing the community what they are capable of achieving.\n\n  \n\n\nThe more ideas and exploration the community can nurture the faster the ecosystem can learn from and develop better solutions. The more new teams that can be formed the better the diversity and combined efforts that can be made as a community.\n\n  \n\n\nTypes of proposals to include\n\n  \n\n\nAll proposal ideas are welcomed! Proposals must be related to the Cardano ecosystem whether that's a new idea, community initiative, marketing, development, support or any other type of proposal. To get some ideas you can refer to the other Catalyst funding categories!\n\n  \n\n\nPotential success metrics for proposal types\n\n  \n\n\nProposers should clearly identify what problem they are trying to solve, how they aim to solve that problem and share the types of outcomes the community should expect after the proposal is executed.\n\n  \n\n\nProposal maximum budget\n\n  \n\n\nThe maximum proposal budget that can be requested is $40,000.\n\n  \n\n\nConsiderations for proposers\n\n  \n\n\n* Existing initiatives and projects - Proposers are encouraged to share in their proposal if there are similar proposals looking to achieve what they are requesting funding for.

The study was formulated and published in the form of an Abstract.\n\n\n\nThis Abstract was an early roadmap of sorts that was apparently responsible for Catalyst itself. It laid out concepts of Decentralization and the Treasury, which funds Catalyst and a lot of current infrastructure.\n\n-\n\nThe study called for a Marketing category as an essential in the Catslyst system. One of only six essential categories. As Catalst and the Cardano ecosystem has evolved and grown, this most important category has been overlooked, while the other five have had more focus.\n\n\n\nThis category - Marketing - was so important to the framers of the Treasury foundation, they stated it should be the largest budgeted category!\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe abstract being discussed and referenced is:\n\n* A Treasury System for Cryptocurriences: Enabling Better Collaborative Intelligence\\*\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2018/435.pdf\n\n  \n\n\n authored by:\n\nBingsheng Zhang, Roman Oliynykov &\n\nNamed Balogun\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/832894680290951179/944928803870871562/945364673207873596\n\n  \n\n\nThis abstract (referred to as The Treasury Paper) laid-out the path/roadmap for several critical steps towards Decentralization including:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Catalyst\n\n  \n\n\n2. Voting processes and science\n\n  \n\n\n3. Delegated Voting Representatives\n\n  \n\n\n4. Voting Committee\n\n  \n\n\n5. The Treasury formula\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nWithin the paper - referring to what we now know as Catalyst Challenges, the Abstract on - p16 section 3.12 - proposes to include (at least) the following categories:\n\n  \n\n\nA) Marketing,\n\n  \n\n\nB) Technology adoption,\n\n  \n\n\nC) Development and Security,\n\n  \n\n\nD) Support,\n\n  \n\n\nE) Organization and Management,\n\n  \n\n\nF) General.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nRegarding the Marketing category the Abstract states:\n\n  \n\n\n This covers activities to cryptocurrency market share growth, market analysis, advertisement, conferences, etc. The vastness of the area demands this category should take the biggest percent of the funding budget.\n\n  \n\n\n(Bold and underline added by proposer for emphasis.)\n\n\n\nFund 8 has a budget of $16 million, yet arguably, other than Film & Media there is no marketing category In the Catalyst Challenge. There are few dollars or ADA budgeted towards marketing.\n\n\n\nCharles Hoskinson, in a fairly recent Whiteboard went to great lengths to explain and justify the security, scalability and expression of Cardano and ( paraphrasing) why The Cardano Network has been slow, deliberate and based on the science and papers of past years. This may in part explain the lack of a Marketing budget as stated in the referenced Abstract.\n\n  \n\n\nCharles, in other chats has explained the importance of this years third quarter and the work on projects coming due this fall ( harvest season for farmers).\n\n\n\nThis Challenge setting proposal, suggests it is time to meet the importance and need stated in The Treasury Abstract for a Marketing category. It is time to fund the activities to cryptocurrency market share growth,.\n\n-\n\n  \n\n\nThe community has demonstrated leadership qualities and readiness for the evolving decentralization of Cardano. It is time for the community to take the lead in meeting the need, stated in The Treasury Report, by budgeting money for Marketing. And, help the growth throughout the Cardano ecosystem. This new category will bring a focus and emphasis on Marketing the successes and new developments of Cardano and work towards increasing the value of ADA.\n\n-\n\n  \n\n\nThe amount requested for the first Marketing Challenge of the Cardano Ecosystem may not fulfill the demand in The Treasury Abstract of this category should take the biggest percent of the funding budget. But, it is a beginning.\n\n  \n\n\nFund 8 has a $16,000,000.00 budget with the greatest category at $2,500,000. Fund 9 will likely be $20 - 25 million or slightly greater. We do not expect a doubling of the budget this round. \n\n\n\nPer the Treasury paper the Marketing budget should be funded at the largest percentage. The six essential categories if evenly funded would be set at $3.3 mil each with a $20 mil Challenge budget. $4,000,000 would equate to the greatest percentage. Several minor categories will crop up to absorb differences. \n\n-\n\n  \n\n\nA charting of Challenge & funding by the proposer\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/756943420660121600/938750947604193310/949487552946122784\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe request for a central Marketing and Community Development Challenge Category for Fund 9 should seriously be considered by the community. It was deemed by the authors of the Treasury Report to be one of six essential categories and the one that should have the largest budget percentage.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Community Outreach and Hub Growth Challenges should be absorbed into this Marketing and Community Development Challenge. This would simplify focus and remove overlapping efforts.\n\n  \n\n\nThank you for reading this proposal and for taking the time to be involved and part of this experiment! @headelf\n\n","proposal_importance":"Marketing.

Globally, over 50% of the world's population lives in urban areas today. By 2045, the world's urban population will increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion [1]. Cities play an increasingly important role in tackling climate change because their exposure to climate and disaster risk increases as they grow. Around 90% of urban expansion in developing countries is near hazard-prone areas and built through informal and unplanned settlements [2]. Besides, cities are also at the frontline of combating epidemics [2]. City governments in developing countries are finding pilot blockchain projects on the urban scale as proof of experiment for related policy proposals of blockchain adoption.\n\nAs a result, there are various problems in cities that waiting to be solved by applying blockchain technology in general, and Cardano blockchain, in particular. Integrating Cardano into regional and urban level projects can strongly support:\n\n1. The faster adoption of Cardano in reality.\n2. The enforcement of UNs Sustainable Development Goals, especially the following goals:\n* 7. Affordable and Clean Energy\n* 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth\n* 9. Industrial Innovation and Infrastructure\n* 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities.\n\nThe potential for Cardano blockchain technology to reduce administrative expenses involved with urban planning might save cities a lot of money. Finally, blockchain technology has the potential to increase community participation through secure, easily-accessible voting systems pertaining to urban and regional planning decisions.\n\n  \n\n\n*Possible directions*\n\nSolutions for applying Cardano, especially Defi and NFT into solving urban problems of the developing world, including\n\n* Events with experts (from Think Tanks, city's agencies, city leaders, smart city developers,...) to introduce and discuss how Cardano may serve and integrate into their scheme for smart cities, innovation city,...\n* Affordable housing development; Crowdfunding for financing urban services; Land, property, and housing management (through tokenization of urban land, housing, and other assets).\n* Solution of Mobility payment and other solutions for improving public transit\n* Solution for Urban planning and urban management\n* Energy / Water / Pollution Management\n* Green Building: solutions, certificates (NFTs,...),...\n* Smart city, Smart buildings,...\n\n  \n\n\nThis proposed budget for this challenge can not be enough for massive projects but may serve as seeds for initiatives to grow in cities.\n\nWe had scientists, experts, communitiy members who have common interest in this theme.\n\nThis challenge may serve as a bridge to connect Cardano to existing agendas, strategies, master plans,... of urban governments in developing countries\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Source of Citation*\n\n[1] https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview#1\n\n[2] https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview#1\n\n","proposal_importance":"Cities are the growth engines of economies.\n\nCity leaders need to see the Cardano-based projects on an urban scale for further adoption.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Cardano is integrated into the development programs, strategies, and urban scale projects in developing cities for application.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about\n\n* The number of proposals for integrating Cardano into development programs, strategies, and urban scale projects in developing countries.\n* The number of events organized for introducing Cardano to Cities' governments/agencies.\n* The number of development programs, strategies, and urban projects have Cardano integrated for application.\n* The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs).\n* Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure, or success, that helps us understand the issues of deploying Cardano solutions across cities?\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":348,"proposal_id":"402050","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"PDF - Proud Dirt Farmers - a DAO","proposal_summary":"There are 570 million Farms globally.

(from Ancient Greek: ??????, romanized: praxis) is the process by which a theory, lesson, or skill is enacted, embodied, or realized. \"Praxis\" may also refer to the act of engaging, applying, exercising, realizing, or practicing ideas.\n\n  \n\n\nWe chose the word \"praxis\" because it is time to engage, apply, and practice our theories of governance in many parallel experiments. It's time to enact and do governance through experiments and trials and share what we learn. It's time to put the ideas into practice and to reflect, iterate, and improve. Voltaire is coming, and the community can have a great deal of input into what that looks like, but we have very little practical knowledge of what works and what doesn't. Let's change that by encouraging experiments in parallel and gaining the critical knowledge and experience needed to make better choices for how we implement governance in Cardano.\n\n  \n\n\nPotential Directions:\n\n  \n\n\n* Experiments in decentralized decision-making and consensus\n* Experiments in sociocracy, holocracy\n* Alternative problem sensing and input gathering strategies\n* Building welcoming spaces and increasing participation\n* Experiments in human swarm behavior and super-collective consciousness\n* Better training in meeting facilitation and group collaboration\n* Experiments in consensus-building mechanisms and building networks\n* Teaching roles and responsibilities in a Liquid Democracy\n* Broad mentorship from Industry professionals\n* Panel Discussions by Governance Topics\n* More experiments!\n","proposal_importance":"To achieve the highest potential of human collaboration, we need to try new approaches and have the opportunity to experiment and learn.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Multiple parallel governance experiments trying new methods & systems of human organization and collaboration.Community-designed governance.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"* Number of experiments we are able to run\n* Effectiveness of collaboration and cooperation\n* More effective and fair decision-making models created\n* Reflection on successes and failures (especially failures) so we learn\n* Increasing governance capacity of the community\n* Better understanding of role of human relationships in decentralized governance\n* Number of new educational groups\n* Number of experiments with consensus-building mechanisms\n* Number of people involved in D-Reps and Liquid Democracy\n* Number of ADA delegated to D-Reps\n* Number of people participating in the governance layer of Catalyst (Catalyst Circle, Admin Team, Oversight Team, etc.)\n* Number of people participating in Catalyst\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":368,"proposal_id":"401628","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Transparancy in Campaign Financing","proposal_summary":"\"Dark Money\" in political campaigns throughout the entire world runs in exact opposition to the entire ethos of Decentralization.","proposal_public_key":"Ks51UukTQQm4vH9kd3d+OQSSa0QyDE1qm75vOWLF8RQ=","proposal_funds":1000,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBv6E","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":108,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"Marty Diamond","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/King_O_Diamond","proposer_relevant_experience":"Life.\n\nI've added what I consider to be the best summary of my relevant experience in the website repository, and it is by far the quickest and easiest way for me to be contacted with any further questions if clarification is needed."},"chain_proposal_id":"2e57fca716ac6882e8dfa1639302a342df1f9dd848d01272de68a361d0f31505","chain_proposal_index":254,"chain_vote_options":{"no":1,"yes":0},"chain_voteplan_id":"286077568d430a2cf7177a8c2e45fc182ee75043101b6fcaf76679ccf5915a38","chain_vote_start_time":"2022-08-11T09:00:00Z","chain_vote_end_time":"2022-08-25T13:00:00Z","chain_committee_end_time":"2022-09-04T13:00:00Z","chain_voteplan_payload":"private","chain_vote_encryption_key":"ristretto255_votepk1q6wly9lc55ms2snz60w6q86t22uwr2876l09cajs3yuj8h0q9sdsdwz7rc","fund_id":8,"challenge_id":15,"reviews_count":4,"proposal_solution":"I have no solution at this time, as my current understaning of crypto-technology and block-chain technology limits my ability to provide one","challenge_type":"simple"},{"internal_id":369,"proposal_id":"401616","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Bridge Builders Operations","proposal_summary":"Projects can be accelerated and improved with timely mentoring.

situation:\n\nThrough 7 Funds, Catalyst management still reveals many shortcomings, such as:\n\n* The total volume of Ada participating in voting for project selection is incredibly low (Fund 7 only ~12% of Ada participated in voting).\n* The roles of CA, vCA are limited and controversial. Some CAs, vCAs have signs of using bots for their evaluation to maximize the benefit, negatively affecting genuine CAs & vCAs.\n* The number of projects realized and influenced by Cardano in the reality is limited.\n\n  \n\n\nThe questions are: (1) How to get the attention of Ada holders and motivate them to vote for or against a proposal; (2) How to attract great proposers to proposed excellent projects for Cardano ecosystem; and (3) How to minimize the controversial issues originated from CAs, vCAs while maximizing their role as experts. These three questions have the same answer: Financial Benefit or Catalyst Fund Governance.\n\n  \n\n\nPurpose of this challenge:\n\nThe purpose of this challenge is to create a place to attract innovative idea/solution about How to govern the Catalyst Fund to solve the three above-mentioned questions.\n\n  \n\n\nLooking at current situation of Catalyst fund, it is managing three players, namelys: (1) Proposers; (2) Ada holders; and (3) CAs/vCAs. For the benefit of Cardano ecosystem, the two formers are the key players. Recommended proposals within this challenge should, therefore, focus their attention on building the governance mechanism of the Catalyst fund on Ada holders and proposers.\n\n  \n\n\n- For ADA holders, when the reward is attractive, they will participate in voting for qualified proposals since such good proposals will bring value to Cardano ecosystem, or Ada holders themselves. For the selection of qualified proposals to vote for, naturally, Ada holders will utilize the participation of experts (CA, vCA) because this directly affects their interests. In turn, CA and vCA will automatically doing their best to attract the selection of Ada holders. And, of course, Ada holders will be the one who pays for expert's works (CA/vCA's reviews). Cheating and/or poor review will soon die down, as a consequence.\n\n- For proposers, in order to receive votes from Ada holders, their project itself must be excellent and well approaches Ada holders. Proposers, therefore, will find the best way to introduce their proposals to the community in order to get funded and maximize their benefits. It will in turn marketing Cardano to the community, naturally.\n\n  \n\n\nProposal size:\n\nProposers' need to think outside of the current Catalyst approach to create a breakthrough in Catalyst fund governance. A proposer team is welcome to propose a total solution for the governance of Catalyst fund mechanism both technical and in content with the whole fund of the challenge if the solution is presented in a clear and convincing manner.\n\n  \n\n\nBudget rationale:\n\nTo be able to propose a Catalyst fund governance mechanism, the proposers' team needs to include qualified personnel in governance, with professional knowledge and understanding of Catalyst funds. The team needs to brainstorm various options before getting to the optimal one to propose to the Catalyst.

Diverse talent with its multitude of viewpoints leads to better innovation. Creating a more inclusive community will lead to a diversity of ideas and thoughts as well as a better sense of belonging. An innovation platform cannot afford to be homogeneous. If we want inclusive culture and a richer perspective, we have to listen to those who are different from the majority.\n\n  \n\n\nTo an outsider, Catalyst is a blur. To a newcomer, it can be confusing. To those who stay, it's still confusing. How might we make Catalyst a safe and welcoming place for all kinds of people?\n\n  \n\n\nIn the world of business, theres a saying Great employee experience leads to great customer experience. More than just financial rewards, people long for a sense of mastery, autonomy and purpose (see e.g. Daniel Pink: \"Drive\").\n\n  \n\n\n\"People who see the world differently and have diverse ideas and perspectives often bring creativity and innovation to an organization. But because of their outsider status, they may struggle to have their ideas recognized by colleagues as legitimate.\" (Harvard Business Review: \"The New Analytics of Culture\")\n\n  \n\n\nGreat culture is good for successful recruitment and retention of diverse talent. If people dont feel included, trusted and heard, they will either leave or remain lurkers forever. Culture needs to be built into the core of the organization and it needs to be nurtured over time via initiatives that encourage constructive sharing of ideas.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are many lenses, or paradigms, through which one can view diversity:\n\n  \n\n\nResistance: Demand for diversity, coming from outside of the monocultural core group, is viewed as a threat to the perceived unity or a non-issue, something that is not important enough to even discuss. People feel safer working with similar colleagues so any attempts to increase diversity are stifled.\n\n  \n\n\nNon-discrimination: Also referred to as Color-Blindness or meritocracy, this paradigm focuses on equal employment opportunities but without acknowledging potential differences due to different backgrounds. The thinking goes: People should be treated equally no matter where they are from; cultural background does not count and does not need to be specifically dealt with. Thinking we are all the same aims to assimilate and hide diversity; important differences are not valued.\n\n  \n\n\nFairness: In this paradigm, diversity is seen as a matter of equal opportunity and fair treatment. An organization addresses the need for specific support for minority groups, reducing social inequalities. While the concern for fairness is genuine, this is good for the organizations image and helps recruitment, while guaranteeing compliance with legal and social requirements. People operating from this standpoint may have good intentions but fall short in truly utilizing diversity for the organizations and its members' full benefit. Preserving harmony may stifle creative dissent.\n\n  \n\n\nAccess and legitimacy: In this paradigm, differences are celebrated but only because they make business sense. The thinking goes that for the organization to be relevant, it needs to portray the same diversity as the global society it operates in. The danger of this approach is that monoculture remains the norm and the diverse are kept on the sidelines. People may feel exploited if they find out that they are there just to make the organization look diverse.\n\n  \n\n\nLearning and growth: This final paradigm also promotes equal opportunity, acknowledges differences and values them but it doesnt assimilate everyone into one mold or form silos and pockets of diversity. Instead, it connects people with diverse traits, backgrounds, knowledge and skills. Listening is encouraged and differences are internalized so that the organization can learn and grow because of them.\n\n  \n\n\nThe benefits of adopting the learning and growth paradigm are clear:\n\n  \n\n\n* It brings new ideas and different knowledge for everyones use.\n* It helps us to develop new skills and approaches to the work we do.\n* It helps us become more innovative as individuals, as teams and as a whole organization.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen culture of inclusion becomes a collective strength, it helps align strategies with peoples diverse capabilities. However, it takes time and needs to be enabled through a consciously built culture that encourages trust and belonging.\n\n  \n\n\nIn this kind of culture, everyone feels at ease, no matter how heated the daily discussions get. In a truly effective innovation platform, it is not only okay to voice out differing opinions; it is expected.\n\n  \n\n\nAn ideal Catalyst Culture:\n\n  \n\n\n* Is fun, relaxed and welcoming.\n* Communicates that diversity of background, opinion and insight are essential.\n* Creates an expectation of high standards of performance from everyone.\n* Stimulates personal development and emotional intelligence.\n* Promotes peer mentoring and learning from one another.\n* Encourages openness, trust, asking, listening and a sense of belonging.\n* Makes people feel heard, respected and valued.\n* Breathes life into a well-articulated and widely understood mission.\n* Supports and maintains an egalitarian and non-bureaucratic structure.\n* Allows a degree of creative friction for innovation to flourish.\n\n  \n\n\nExamples of proposals you could submit to this challenge:\n\n* Educational events to explore the related concepts and research\n* Discussion fora to help us understand each other and to work better together\n* Use of software to make meeting culture more inclusive (e.g. Otter & Equalicert)\n* Analysis tools to understand how culture influences Catalyst members' thoughts and behaviour.\n* Social media content creation to help raise awareness\n* Tools that help in recruitment and onboarding of top talent\n* Incentives for bringing different types of people together in teams\n* Surveys, interviews and documentation of \"the Catalyst pulse\"\n* Systems and processes that strengthen inclusiveness in Catalyst\n* Partnerships with external expert organizations\n* Initiatives to clarify our shared mission, vision, values and goals\n* Competence development tools and frameworks\n* Mentoring, coaching and peer support structures and solutions\n* Wellbeing and community listening related initiatives\n* Celebrations, rites, rituals and other cultural artefacts to strengthen the culture\n* Leadership development initiatives\n* Equal participation and engagement initiatives\n\n  \n\n\nIt is up to all of us to propose initiatives that help strengthen the most important asset Cardano has: the community. Let us know what piece of the puzzle you suggest solving.\n\n  \n\n\n* How could we take steps towards a stronger Catalyst Culture?\n* What initiatives can be implemented to help us become more effective working together?\n* How might we facilitate the integration of our differences for the benefit of organizational learning, improved capacity for innovation and for the general wellbeing of everyone involved?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nCo-proposers\n\n  \n\n\nJo Allum: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joallum/\n\n  \n\n\nÖzgür Yaºar Akyar: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar/\n\n  \n\n\nNori Nishigaya: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishigaya/\n\n  \n\n\nTomi Astikainen: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomiastikainen/\n\n  \n\n\nDzhuliana Nikolova: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dzhuliana-nikolova-b6805714a/\n\n  \n\n\nAlignment with the Fund9 strategic goals\n\nFund9 Challenge Setting proposals are supposed to meet one or more of these attributes. Here's our commentary for CA consideration:\n\n \n\n* *Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.*\n* This challenge setting proposal aims to make it easier for anyone to join and find their place in Catalyst, becoming active participants faster than today.\n* *Turn Cardano into an open source project.*\n* Commonly agreed on culture helps pull in the same direction and this shared team spirit lessens the need for centralized control.\n* *Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem.*\n* One of the issues that can be addressed with common culture initiatives is the perceived gap between \"the developers\" and \"the governors\".\n\n  \n\n\nWe, the challenge team members, feel that this challenge setting is geared to address all three aspects of the Fund9 goals.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSources:\n\n  \n\n\nMaking Differences Matter:\n\nhttps://hbr.org/1996/09/making-differences-matter-a-new-paradigm-for-managing-diversity\n\n  \n\n\nManaging a Culturally Diverse Workforce\n\nhttps://copdei.extension.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Managing-a-culturally-diverse-workforce.pdf\n\n  \n\n\nDiversity and Team Leadership in a Nonprofit Organization:\n\nhttps://lutpub.lut.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/30829/TMP.objres.268.pdf\n\n  \n\n\nThe New Analytics of Culture\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture\n\n","proposal_importance":"Inclusive culture guarantees that we have people with different perspectives.

The best way to fight greenhouse gasses is by reducing energy-consumption. But this is not enough, we need to make the Cardano ecosystem Climate Positive; if achieved, the World will be a more regenerative, better place. We should incentivize that with at least a small % of our collective Potential.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat began as a challenge, has turned into a community: Cardano4Climate\n\n  \n\n\nWhile holding weekly meetups for 6 month now we have engaged with many different proposers and projects. Last funding round as a community, we have identified [1]many proposals already that were closely related to this challenge and we invited many more to the [2]sustainability event that we hold continuously now.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen talking about the fundamentals of Climate Change itself we would like to encourage you to read up on the papers and the official reports. We specifically refer to the [3]IPCC reports (we also linked a shorter and easier to read press-release in the links section):\n\n  \n\n\n\"GENEVA, Aug 9  Scientists are observing changes in the Earth's climate in every region and across the whole climate system, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, released today. Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motionsuch as continued sea level riseare irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"The report projects that in the coming decades climate changes will increase in all regions. For 1.5°C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. At 2°C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report shows.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net zero CO2 emissions. Limiting other greenhouse gasses and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate\"\n\n  \n\n\nHow will this challenge provide a springboard for Cardano adoption?\n\n  \n\n\nThe green-movement is bigger than ever and companies like Tesla are immensely popular and successful not because they make cars that accelerate faster, but because their electric and therefore environmentally friendly cars are clearly one very important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventing climate change. If we had to take a *wild guess* as to what one of the other pieces of the puzzle could be, we would propose looking into better governance systems for example. By having experiments on the topic of climate change, not only will Catalyst contribute to preventing climate change but also position Cardano as the green blockchain of the future and hopefully Catalyst will learn about how to deal with such urgent and tough problems.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHow will this challenge advance Cardano's mission?\n\n  \n\n\nIf we can't build Systems that are better than our traditional Systems, what are we doing here?

The introduction of these new technologies also opens the doors to new possibilities.\n\nAlthough many efforts are being made by international blockchain communities to explore new opportunities in the country, not many people have proposed solutions with Cardanos technology.\n\nThus, to start we propose the following areas of relevance for the countrys advancement that might be a good entry point for the creation of Cardano powered solutions:\n\n\\* DeFI: The percentage of the unbanked population is high, and the facilities that credit access for entrepreneurs is pretty low. This leads to a segmentation of the population that has proper financial means, and limits the capabilities of consumers and small businesses.\n\\* Natural Disasters Response: El Salvador is subject to a number of environmental risks, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and flooding, which tend to take a toll on the population.\n\\* Education: Like many countries in Latin America, El Salvador is subject to low standards and unequal access to education.\n \\* Elementary Education: The average dropout rate of schools is high across the country, and only a few percent of people manage to make it to university, which spoils the professional and productive capabilities of the country.\n \\* Technical Education: Theres a lack of availability and affordability for technical education. Even outside universities, the companies that actually provide these services tend to be outdated with their content, and the graduates are not job-ready.","proposal_importance":"The growing exposure to blockchain technology in the country creates an environment thats positioned for change and innovation.","proposal_goal":"Deployment of creative solutions using Cardanos technology, further driving the adoption of blockchain and the development of the country.","proposal_metrics":"\\* An increased growth in the number of Cardano Blockchain projects in the Country.\n\n\\* Measurable growth in the countrys awareness of Cardanos technology.\n\n\\* Number of lives positively impacted by the projects proposed.\n\n\\* Number of existing businesses being onboarded into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\\* Number of new businesses being developed through the use of Cardanos Technology.","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":515,"proposal_id":"400622","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Community Advisors Marketing Blitz","proposal_summary":"Many Cardano users are unaware of project catalyst and community advisor role specifically.

These services require excellent expert-teams, who need to work under sufficiently stable conditions for not being personally exploited (otherwise it is easy to run into burnout situations). Most of these services do NOT have project-character, they require trust, relationship and continuity.\n\n  \n\n\nDedicate ONE CHALLENGE SETTING to an alternative and modern subscription model\n\nWe can learn from industry and apply an agile, quarterly-rolling subscription model. This would give the community sufficient leverage that service providers dont get 'lazy' and really deliver the promised value AND would give the service providers the required stable environment in order to be able to establish performing teams and organisations. Such a modern subscription funding can e.g. constructed as following:\n\n  \n\n\n* Getting Votes in Quarter n: 100% bindingly subscription as per Statement of Work in Quarter n+1\n* Quarter n+2 = If not selected again, falling back to 75% of the subscription\n* Quarter n+3 = If not selected again, falling back to 25% of the subscription\n* Quarter n+4 = If not selected again, falling back to 0\n\n  \n\n\nThis way, the community does not need to enter into any static 'annual subscriptions' and the service providers must proof their value quarter by quarter - but will not fall from 100% to 0 over night\n\n  \n\n\nPossible proposers\n\n* Every service provider that is not an individual (where 'employment' could be better)\n* Every service provider with strong value to the Cardano Community, but also with a strong value to the 'outside world' (reaching business, governments, NGOs, and/or acting cross-chain etc).\n","proposal_importance":"Applying project-based funding to such services creates huge administrative tasks, personal overload and economic insecurity.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Success is that the community can get the required professional (and continuous) services in high quality without 'burning people'.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"For the community it should be quite easy to vote on and select really value-adding services. This challenge setting can be measured by the following metrics (examples):\n\n  \n\n\n* Number of trusted repetitive services (funding based on 'Statement of Work' and agile subscription)\n* Frequency of use of such services\n* Quarterly NPS (Net Promoter Score) as rating for such services\n* Number of experts working in such service organisations\n* Diversity and inclusiveness of service providers\n* Level of external outreach (reaching business, governments, NGOs etc)\n* Cross-chain and interoperability outreach of such service\n* etc.\n\n  \n\n\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":616,"proposal_id":"400079","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Perun Channels for Cardano","proposal_summary":"Cardano does not have a deployed state channel framework, yet.

Many early stage ventures are now launching into the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst wants to fuel many pioneering successes.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough the past year, we saw many projects emerging from within the Catalyst Ecosystem. Projects like Catalyst Circle, Catalyst Swarm, Catalyst School, Gimbalabs, WADA, QA DAO, AIM, Eastern Town Hall, etc. follow a similar pattern while facing the same Problem:\n\n  \n\n\nEmerged Projects from within Project Catalyst have to apply each funding round for Funds to ensure that needed resources are in place. Submitting specific proposals, addressed to presented challenges does not necessarily match the Projects need for stable resourcing.\n\n  \n\n\nFurthermore, Project Catalyst's goal is to be a self-sustaining Governance Body in the hands of the community. There are already several Projects that work towards this goal, by providing value to not only the community but importantly to the development of Project Catalyst itself. \n\n  \n\n\nThis Challenge aims to support these Projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem which:\n\n  \n\n\n* Got funded through minimum two Catalyst Funding rounds\n* Emerged by the necessity to solve a specific problem within our ecosystem\n* Received funds mainly via voted Proposals in Project Catalyst\n* Create and maintain an active and inclusive community around their project\n* Have the need to apply constantly for funds to build out their projects\n* Team Members proactively participate in the broader Catalyst Processes by taking the initiative and responsibility via Catalyst Roles (E.g CA,CT,CC etc.)\n\n  \n\n\nProposals in this challenge should show some planning or strategy to indicate a pathway to sustainability (no longer needing Catalyst funds over time), or provide some evidence that they are an operational function of Catalyst that has no profit or sustainability pathway independently (eg.

In particular, the shortage of development funds and engineers is serious, and students have few opportunities to get these resources. However, Catalysts are easier to raise money than VCs(Venture Capital) and Business Contests, and also can connect globally with engineers in this community. However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students. In addition, it is difficult to set a clear Roadmap while resources are scarce and to get a high evaluation from CA(Community Advisor).\n\nTherefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of $ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst. In continued participation in Catalyst, funding experience, even on a small scale, is evaluated by the community. Therefore, it is important to set a budget limit.\n\nThe Category Goal is to encourage engineers to scout students who are evaluated by the community and create a new team to join the next Fund with a clear Roadmap. This is a benefit for both students and engineers to raise a large salary for engineers through Catalyst rather than from VCs or Banks.\n\n\\*\\*Team & Relevant experience\\*\\*\n\n?Issa Ichikawa (Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cardano\\_ISSA)\n\n21-year-old/Junior at Waseda University in Japan/Student entrepreneur/Catalyst Fund6 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)\n\n?YUTA (Twitter: https://twitter.com/yuta\\_cryptox)\n\nCardano Ambassador/SPO/Japan representative of Eastern Town Hall Meeting/Catalyst Fund2,6,7 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)","proposal_importance":"Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment.","proposal_goal":"By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers.","proposal_metrics":"?Number of proposals for this category\n\n?Number of applause and comments from the community\n\n?Number of proposals that could be collaborated with other engineers\n\n?Number of proposals that participated in the next fund","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":686,"proposal_id":"399730","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Cardano Stonerz Club Community Hub!","proposal_summary":"The Cardano Stonerz Club is already a valued Cardano community Hub.

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community's support and build on or use the Cardano network.\n\n  \n\n\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include East Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\n\n  \n\n\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\n\n  \n\n\nCardano started life in East Asia *(Japan and Hong Kong)*, and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let's build upon that.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat this is\n\n  \n\n\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\n\n  \n\n\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\n\n  \n\n\nIt is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born withallowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.\n\n","proposal_importance":"The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.\n\n","proposal_goal":"A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation :\n\n  \n\n\n1. The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst\n2. The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams\n3. The observed impact of funded projects *(meeting their KPIs)*\n4. Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?\n5. Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets *(DAW/MAW)* as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement\n6. Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia?\n\n  \n\n\nWe will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals :\n\n  \n\n\n1. Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia?\n2. What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions?\n3. Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia?\n4. Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?\n5.

Think globally; act locally.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen the platform is fully functional and a critical mass of users is reached, the intention would be to switch to targeted engagement with existing local government policy processes and electoral systems, building up from there to regional and then national level, fostering voting public understanding and trust along the way.\n\n  \n\n\nThe long-term strategy is to allow communities to self-organise without explicitly needing representatives, and to stand independent candidates elected to act on the collective will of the people until governance systems can be reformed into a coordinated, distributed democracy.\n\n  \n\n\nThis is the seed for a parallel system of democracy that seeks to shift the status quo and bring about a reformation of democratic governance into one that is digitally driven, deliberative, decentralised and fit for the 21st Century.\n\n  \n\n\nF8 Challenge setting voters and proposers should recognise that globally there are over 10 million not-for-profits, 3 million co-operatives, plus many millions more unincorporated groups, clubs and associations worldwide that use democratic processes to manage trillions in transactions and assets:\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/facts-and-figures\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2168791/28124/en/Global-NGOs-and-Charitable-Organizations-Market-Report-2020-Market-is-Expected-to-Decline-from-255-705-9-Million-in-2019-to-253-336-3-Million-in-2020-Forecast-to-2030.html\n\n  \n\n\nThe Challenge Brief\n\n  \n\n\nThere are currently no integrated toolkits that allow democratic organisations to function via a single sign on. While the enterprise and small business market demands are partially fulfilled by many vendors with scalable solutions, the not-for-profit sector, community groups and civil society organisations have to make do with stitching together various open source tools and paid software to try to achieve their organisational goals.\n\n  \n\n\nNone of these tools make it easy for members of these organisations to collaborate and make good decisions, or provide visibility and accountability over their finances to members and stakeholders.\n\n  \n\n\nThis Challenge proposal aims to establish the ground work to build this needed platform. The diagram of system components attached to the challenge brief isn't meant to be a final design, just a pastiche to show the complexity of what could be included as the ecosystem evolves.\n\n  \n\n\nGiven the nature of creating complex ecosystems on limited budgets that not-for-profits need to run, we have really decided to emphasise \"Challenge\" as explained in the following 3 requirements:\n\n  \n\n\nRequirement 1 - Integration Work\n\n  \n\n\nThere are 3 integration components that should be included in proposals submitted to this fund:\n\n  \n\n\n*1) A democratic component that involves the use of the Cardano blockchain.* \n\n  \n\n\nThis could be a dApp or app focused on voting mechanisms, ideation facilitation, consensus-building processes or tokenomics frameworks for rewards schemes, participatory budget tracking and accountability etc. However, the key requirement is that it must make use of the Cardano blockchain to be eligible.\n\n  \n\n\n*2) Integration of at least one more democracy related app produced by a different proposal team or vendor.* \n\n  \n\n\nThe second app could be another Cardano based dApp but there should be flexibility in this to encourage collaboration across projects and find out what difficulties exist when trying to integrate apps from different suppliers and technologies other than Cardano.\n\n  \n\n\nThe integration should see the 2 apps share data or workload to implement a solution.\n\nExamples would be an ideation tool passing data to a voting system, a voting system passing the result to a payments system, an identity management system passing registered voters to the voting system, a DAO builder that verifies participation via an electoral register lookup, an AGM tool that can display the proposals via a video conference and allow votes to be collected in real time and so on. Limitless options!\n\n  \n\n\n*3) Use of a single sign on to allow users to access features in both apps.*\n\nThere should be no need to hold multiple passwords or to login to different apps. It might be obvious where the boundary of a system is due to interface changes, but it should work as seamlessly as using a single app.\n\n  \n\n\n*Stretch goals to stand out and impress voters:*\n\n  \n\n\n1) Make use of Atala Prism as part of the single sign-on solution to handle user credentials.\n\n1a) Allow place based participation credentials for non-governmental organisations.\n\n1b) Support electoral constituency credentials for government institutions or organisations related to government administration areas.\n\n  \n\n\n2) Formally collaborate and pair up with other proposal submitters to extend the range of applications that are integrated rather than duplicating applications. The perfect results would be 4 or more proposal teams delivering a suite of 8+ applications using 1 single sign on solution.\n\n  \n\n\n3) Use of distributed storage and compute for hosting apps such as internetcomputer.org, IPFS, nunet.io, threefold.io etc. (There is an F8 proposal for a Cardano Decentralised Storage solution).\n\n  \n\n\nRequirement 2 - Community Onboarding\n\n  \n\n\nThere have been many attempts at digital democracy apps in the past but none has really managed to inspire the population at large and gained significant use.\n\n  \n\n\nProposers should bring in at least 2 distinct organisations as test participants. This is to ensure the integrated tool set gets real world feed back as part of a Beta Test / User Acceptance Test. Each organisation could be a small not-for-profit, an online community such as Catalyst, or even a large cooperative if there's a valid use case for them.\n\n  \n\n\nProposers can decide if they want to incentivise this participation by including in their proposal an ADA grant to not-for-profit organisations for use of their time. They should also ensure compliance with any local tax or crypto legislation.\n\n  \n\n\nGetting new democratically oriented organisations onboarded and versed in multi-signature wallet use and decentralised technology should be seen favourably by voters, so the size and reach of organisations should be assessed when voting on proposals.\n\n  \n\n\n*Stretch goals:* \n\n1) Recruit partner organisations across multiple continents instead of 1 country to be able to test with groups from different cultures and languages.\n\n  \n\n\n2) Again formal collaboration and pairing up with other proposal submitters would allow a wider user community to be involved in evaluating the range of applications that are integrated.\n\n  \n\n\nRequirement 3 - Cost Constraints.\n\n  \n\n\nInstead of developing new apps and dApps this challenge is focused on integration by using existing solutions. To add a layer of difficulty the challenge fund budget will be limited to $150,000 and the maximum proposal size will be limited to $37,500 to get a minimum of 4 integrations. More if teams can keep costs lower.\n\n  \n\n\n*Stretch Goal*\n\nThe lower the proposal cost the more likely it will be accepted by the voting community as value for money does count. That said, do not sacrifice quality!\n\n  \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nPanacea is an informal group of professionals collaborating together through common interests spanning emergent technology, new potentials for democracy, and new forms of decentralised organisational structure.\n\n  \n\n\nOur driving force is the recognition that current socioeconomic, political and financial institutions adhere to forms of governance that are no longer fit for purpose and do not represent the best interests of the vast majority of people. Instead, they are used to wield power, exert control and concentrate wealth in the vested interest of the privileged few.\n\n  \n\n\nWe have developed an approach that could stimulate the grass roots adoption of distributed governance tools and processes, which when integrated effectively with decentralised finance could eventually replace the established order with one designed to encourage cooperation and collaboration instead of competition and domination.\n\n  \n\n\nThe challenge fund size is purposely kept small to produce a limited number of prototypes in F9 with further proposals planned for F10.\n\n","proposal_importance":"Governance is failing humanity, but there exists the potential to overcome the world's greatest challenges through digital disruption.\n\n","proposal_goal":"A truly collaborative digital democracy ecosystem that's easy to participate in and generates the best solutions for all involved.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"Number of projects and initiatives engaged and participating in co-design.\n\n  \n\n\nNumber and size of partner organisations onboarded into platform trials.\n\n  \n\n\nNumber of active users brought onto platform trials.\n\n  \n\n\nExpected transactions generated by platform integration.\n\n  \n\n\nDiversity of nationalities and cultures of groups involved.\n\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":866,"proposal_id":"398633","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Immigration Documents On Chain","proposal_summary":"Immigration documents at U.S. colleges and around the world are paper based creating issues paper based solutions have.\n\n","proposal_public_key":"fsdrAzqtDCvraZegBRg6wo77235uT5tsmuNk5dmbnlk=","proposal_funds":1800,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBvH8","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":400,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"Steven Sevic","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"https://github.com/stevesevic/open-source-immigration-ssi","proposer_relevant_experience":"I started IT development and support in early 1990, eventually moved to media production, and in 2015: back to IT in International Education.

We are aiming to involve more team members and upgrade the proposal based on the assessments.\n\nTurkey is a bridge between Asia and Europe including increased connection with countries in Africa. It has a large and young population of more than 80M people. It is the home of one of the earliest cryptocurrency exchanges, BTCTurk, which was founded in 2013. As such, Turkish people have been some of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Triple-A research, ~2.4M of the populace own cryptocurrencies. This makes it the nation with the 19th most cryptocurrency users \\[1\\]. This however does not capture the entire picture as the growth of this number has been 10 fold in the past year \\[2\\]. This massive growth can most directly be attributed to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies and to the speedy devaluation of the Turkish Lira (around ~40% against the US Dollar in 2021).\n\nDevaluation of the currency has gotten exceedingly worse and is set to continue in the near future. The negative effects are felt throughout the country as wages tumble on a USD basis. The minimum wage is around $220 as of the time of this proposal (nearly half the working population earn min. wage), meaning any funds put to work in Turkey can get lots of involvement from the local population.\n\nDespite this growth, Cardano adoption is very low. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no broader Cardano community. The majority of the investors in the trading group were drawn to ADA by the performance of the cryptocurrency. As a result, trader emotions like fear and greed dominate the conversation within cryptocurrency communities, resulting in misinformation about the broader Cardano community. As such, a Turkish Cardano community is sorely needed to raise awareness of the vision of Cardano beyond the token price.\n\nWe the proposers of this challenge are trying to do so and bring more qualified Turkish people into the Cardano community. However, we are just a group of three within Project Catalyst with a broader network of around 20 that are involved in cryptocurrencies in Turkey. If the real value of Cardano can be demonstrated in Turkey, this number will dramatically increase. This is especially true given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects. However, they face language obstacles and lack some of the relevant competencies. Therefore more initiatives are needed to realize the potential of Turkey and to aid the global adoption of Cardano.\n\nGiven these points, what could Turkey offer the Cardano community back in return? Turkey has great potential in its qualified IT and cybersecurity personnel built thanks in part to a solid financial services sector. It also has a large pool of young, active and forward looking individuals, looking to contribute to their communities. This challenge aims to bring this potential to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nGuiding questions\n\nHow can we involve general ADA holders in project Catalyst in Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase the number of SPOs from Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase more meaningful participation from Turkey?\n\nHow can we encourage new members to utilize the tools and services available for onboarding?\n\nHow can we localize the existing materials?\n\nChallange Team\n\nCem Karaca\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca\n\nÖzgür Yaºar Akyar\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar\n\nÇa?kan Acarbay\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fkan-acarbay-b2210b136\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-turkey/.\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/paribu-has-published-the-results-of-the-most-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-survey-cryptocurrency-use-in-turkey-has-increased-by-10-times","proposal_importance":"The decentralisation and resilience of Cardano are based on the inclusion of different locations including those communities not involved.","proposal_goal":"Motivated community of developers, SPOs, stakers, voters, challenge teams collaborating for the growth of Cardano from Turkey in 2023.","proposal_metrics":"We will track and publish measurement of the challenge based on the following metrics\n\nA number of proposals under this challenge.\n\nA number of funded proposals are under this challenge.\n\nAverage CA scores on proposals.\n\nA number of accounts under on proposal under this challenge.\n\nProposals aim at achieving the success of this challenge will be measured throughout the following metrics\n\nNumber of stake pools running in Turkey,\n\nThe number of Project Catalyst proposals from Turkey,\n\nNumber of developers participating in the Cardano Developer Program from Turkey,\n\nIncreased number of educational tools about the Cardano in Turkish,\n\nIncreased awareness about the Cardano blockchain in Turkish speaking communities,\n\nThe number of roles taken in Project Catalyst as CA, general voters, challenge team members, members of the catalyst circle by Turkish individuals.","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":873,"proposal_id":"398567","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"SPO Dashboard for Delegators","proposal_summary":"Missing real Stake Pool performance Dashboard where SPO's can show live data.\n\n","proposal_public_key":"3SRMfk2TFygMr1+KhUoUA5Wa+L9xh21ASaYfISrRjHs=","proposal_funds":27900,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBvG3","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":400,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"Lauris | StakePool247 | EU01","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"","proposer_relevant_experience":"SPOCRA board member, Funded proposer, Stake Pool Operator, Stakepool as a Service Provider, SPOs mentor, elected Catalyst Circle member.

Yet it was soon co-opted by powerful corporations.\n\n  \n\n\nWeb3 holds the same promise and our daily interactions happen more and more online. Web3 just goes one step further, promising true decentralization and control of your own data. As we engage with one another, and increasingly with machines, we can become active creators of a truly decentralized Internet of Value. One day, probably sooner than expected, augmented reality interfaces enable us to morph the user experience into a mesh of Metaverses.\n\n  \n\n\nUnfortunately, if this is not done with the highest integrity, transparency and openness in mind, Web3 will face the same faith as Web2. It will be annexed by power-hungry mega enterprises. Any technology can be used with good or bad intentions, and there will be unimagined consequences. At its worst, Metaverse can become a dystopian nightmare that we can't wake up from.\n\n  \n\n\nTherefore, when developing the building blocks of the metaverse and services on it, solid information security and decentralized self-sovereign identity become necessities. Blockchain solutions need to be developed in collaboration with government, nonprofits, educational institutions and business.\n\n  \n\n\nSummary (from PwC):\n\n* Don't believe the hype: the metaverse is an evolution, not a revolution. And it's one that business leaders should not ignore.\n* The metaverse may profoundly change how businesses and consumers interact with products, services and each other.\n* Key metaverse concepts, including digital economy innovations such as cryptocurrencies, are business-relevant today.\n* Risks are real too: new technologies require new strategies and new methods to build trust.\n* Measured actions can allow business leaders to familiarize themselves with the six most important metaverse concepts and explore lower-risk use cases.\n\n  \n\n\nThe building blocks of the metaverse:\n\n  \n\n\nEconomy\n\nCryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other blockchain-based digital currencies, assets and exchanges will likely underpin value exchange across the metaverse. Further innovation will be needed as governments, companies and new, digital-only organizations work to build trusted digital monetary systems, offer new data monetization propositions and conduct lending, payments, real estate investment and more in the metaverse. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)  with voluntarily agreed-upon rules enforced by a computer program that runs on a blockchain  will likely play important roles.\n\n  \n\n\nInteroperability\n\nA true metaverse requires seamless interoperability among users and platforms, based on web 3.0 and still-to-be-determined standards. While this interoperability will offer new possibilities to reach and understand customers, it will also raise new challenges for gathering and protecting data, and for cybersecurity and privacy. It may also undermine business strategies built around keeping users and their data in a given platform. Competitive advantage may shift to those companies that offer (through hardware or software) trusted ways for users to enter the metaverse.\n\n  \n\n\nGovernance\n\nThe metaverse will need rules of engagement for users, rules for how the metaverse itself can change over time and enforcement mechanisms, including for tax collection, data governance and regulatory compliance. Early movers may be able to help set these rules. Security will be paramount, as a new, decentralized digital world may offer malicious actors a new world of entry points for attack. Authenticity  and trust more broadly  should also be front and center, to reduce the disinformation that has often plagued the internet.\n\n  \n\n\nIdentity\n\nIn the internet today, identity is often linked to platforms. It may be true, pseudonymous or anonymous. The metaverse, decentralized and interconnected, will need trusted digital identities  for people, assets and organizations  that port across platforms. Companies active in digital identity now may both help set the metaverses standards and be able to offer a necessary service. Digital identities may also be central to permitted data collection and data governance in a decentralized environment.\n\n  \n\n\nExperience\n\nA shared, persistent and immersive 3D digital world will offer unique experiences, based on its own aesthetics  beliefs, ideals and tastes as expressed in individual choices. Some trends for user experience are already becoming clear, in games and VR / AR environments. Companies that create trusted metaverse experiences and protect privacy rights may win consumer loyalty, while those that stay on top of metaverse trends may be well placed to forecast consumer preferences and behavior.\n\n  \n\n\nPersistence\n\nA true metaverse should reflect in real time the changes made in it by different participants, entering and leaving it in different ways, in different places, at different times. When you take your metaverse headset off, the metaverse and other participants will continue their activities uninterrupted, with (for example) smart contracts enforcing agreements and trading assets. This persistence will likely require a new approach to digital assets and activities, including services and applications that are portable, dynamically configurable and extensible.\n\n  \n\n\nSource: Demystifying the Metaverse\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAlignment with Fund9 strategic goals\n\nFund9 Challenge Setting proposals have to meet one or more of these attributes:\n\n \n\n* *Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.*\n* Because it's so trendy, a metaverse-related challenge can help bring people from outside of Cardano ecosystem into Catalyst.\n* *Turn Cardano into an open source project.*\n* The centralized metaverse model advanced by large corporations is a threat to all things open source. This challenge setting proposal helps Cardano become a notable player in the Open Metaverse.\n* *Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem.*\n* It is safe to assume that metaverse-related initiatives will be exciting for the growth of developer ecosystem and dApp builders, too.\n\n  \n\n\nChallenge Team\n\nYou are welcome to join the challenge team.

For Cardano to succeed in Ethiopia, we need to go beyond the capital, Addis Ababa, and the federal government, to where over 90% of the population lives.\n\n  \n\n\nEthiopia has one of the oldest religious communities who need to upgrade their organizational and administrative structure to the realities of the 22nd century. For example the Ethiopian orthodox church has a membership of over 40 million people with a worldwide reach. It has its own educational institutions and certification standard that it needs to track. Tracking membership and resources. \n\n  \n\n\nEthiopia has community organizations such as Iddirs that support 90% of the population in their time of need when the government is too weak to deliver. The introduction of DAOs could accelerate the adoption of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) leading to building economic identity and reputation. Opportunities for Realfi implementation, unique laws allow for regenerating unproductive, unowned land,...etc. \n\n  \n\n\nChallenge rationale.\n\n*With a specific challenge related to Ethiopia the challenge team is able to:*\n\n* Provide appropriate advice that addresses the particular challenges proposers and potential proposers from Ethiopia face.\n* Connect proposers and potential proposers with mentors, developers, tools builders and implementers that can assist them in their projects.\n* Provide advice in team building according to the Catalyst and Cardano environments.\n* Promote open communication, a safe working environment, and a deep listening culture\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHow will this challenge help Cardano adoption?\n\n* Create community awareness and organizational adoption of Cardano solutions such as Atala Prism, DAO tools and Realfi.\n* Create awareness for local and federal officials\n* Lead to the adoption of favorable rules and regulations for adoption of Cardano and blockchain technologies in Ethiopia\n\n  \n\n\nHow will this challenge advance Cardano's mission?\n\n* Ethiopia and the horn of Africa is in constant crisis with immeasurable human suffering caused by a failing system and broken trust. Blockchain technology removes the need for trusting central organizations and Cardano could lead the way.\n* The young population is looking for work and for hope. They are eager to embrace technology with its tools for protecting sovereignty, while opening up new possibilities for participating through local actions in a global economy.\n\n  \n\n\nTools, methods, processes, principles, and knowledge acquired in the process of mending Ethiopias broken system can be replicated wherever there is crisis brought on by broken systems.\n\n  \n\n\nTeam members\n\nTegegne, Catalyst OG, Community organizer,\n\nNori, Catalyst OG, Facilitator, community builder, mentor\n\nNatnael, Community organizer, content creator, facilitator\n\nBadege, Fresh graduate from college, Engaged in his community in rural Ethiopia, working to make a difference.\n\nShimeles, University Lecturer, mentor\n\n","proposal_importance":"Meaningful community engagement is critical for IOGs effort and vision for Cardano to succeed in Ethiopia. \n\n","proposal_goal":"Increased number of teams, quality of proposals, diversity of proposers, cooperation of proposers and teams.\n\n","proposal_metrics":"* Number of teams and individuals engaged in catalysts.\n* Number of funded and unfunded proposals.\n* Geographic, social, and professional diversity of individuals, teams and proposals\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":967,"proposal_id":"397900","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Decentralized Autonomous Iddir","proposal_summary":"Iddirs are an Ethiopian traditional risk sharing community organizations that has difficulty to scale.\n\n","proposal_public_key":"Im2REp7tZN5zYy88dNfDtDzqk0nvsXxlTLWWFH3v86M=","proposal_funds":24000,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBu57","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":420,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"tefera.tegegne","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"https://iddir.org/","proposer_relevant_experience":"Marine engineer, Master degree in maritime management specializing in maritime pedagogy and training.\n\nCommunity organizer, Opensource enthusiast and localization initiator, coordinator and translator.\n\nCardano enthusiast since 2017, Run ITN, Catalyst member since Fund1, CA, vCA.\n\n"},"chain_proposal_id":"15c3dc8bea86efdc25787348b6d57ce302d4e1dfd8b08feeee1c6a9375e2343c","chain_proposal_index":88,"chain_vote_options":{"yes":0,"no":1},"chain_voteplan_id":"62180373f8af15d03e18ccc4e0dc27a5b8e1491490be4d0459590ae23a149867","chain_vote_start_time":"2022-08-11T09:00:00Z","chain_vote_end_time":"2022-08-25T13:00:00Z","chain_committee_end_time":"2022-09-04T13:00:00Z","chain_voteplan_payload":"private","chain_vote_encryption_key":"ristretto255_votepk1as3kcth7tnc5dxy79gtxuh0sq28ukettcymkm30t3agef2va7g9szdqk0w","fund_id":8,"challenge_id":11,"reviews_count":5,"proposal_solution":"Iddirs can be upgraded as DAOs and scale globally to serve the Ethiopian population at home and in dispora.\n\n","challenge_type":"simple"},{"internal_id":968,"proposal_id":"397877","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"Consenz: Legislation Co-Creation","proposal_summary":"Legislation making requires a different perspective to be taken into consideration.

As such the proposals to this challenge would need to present a detailed timeframe and roadmap to implement a working solution.\n\nUse case example:\n\nAs a key component in the creation of a trustworthy, Cardano based, robustly & elegantly interoperable NFT storage platform.\n\nWhat use is having the record of ownership on an immutable blockchain, if the work that it points to is no longer accessible? Only the metadata gets stored on the blockchain, if the file it points to is no longer available because the location the metadata leads to is no longer available, the NFT itself would probably loses most of its value, regardless if its a piece of digital art, music, or a land lease with attached plans.\n\nPicture how the media would cover the story of an NTF artwork, or possibly even worse, the files attached to the metadata that somebody paid hundreds of thousands of dollars suddenly not being there anymore. After an event such as that, storage permanence would surely become the biggest concern of the general public.\n\n As this is a broad and complex problem we dont necessarily expect full working solutions to emerge out of this first iteration of the challenge.

It is extremely important that these proposals are evaluated/audited to assess what is being delivered and if the Return on Intent (ROI)is in the spirit of with what was originally proposed.\n\n  \n\n\nPresently IOG monitors the progress of these funded proposals. But as the number of funded proposals scales to the 100s this will become an overwhelming workload for IOG. Therefore auditability activities such as monitoring, evaluation, mentoring and reporting will increasingly be handed over to the community.\n\n  \n\n\nOversight of governance\n\n  \n\n\nOversight of governance provides the Cardano community with information on the design, specification, communication, collaboration, voting and implementation of any proposed changes to governance processes.\n\n  \n\n\nAs Voltaire progresses many governance changes will be introduced to the Cardano community. It is important that the community has the information and tools to be able to audit these governance changes, and monitor what results they are producing. Proposals in this area might suggest mechanisms for actually conducting audit; or they might propose ways to increase the communitys awareness and understanding of the changes, and of the theoretical background to them, so that the community is able to assess them.\n\n","proposal_importance":"So funded proposals are evaluated & governance oversight is resourced to ensure accountability & legitimacy through community participation.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Several projects providing audit, assessment & evaluation tools for funded proposals & oversight of governance changes\n\n","proposal_metrics":"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudit of funded proposals:\n\n* Number of funded proposals audited in each Challenge using methods funded in this Challenge\n* The appropriateness of the auditability approaches taken by proposals funded in this Challenge (e.g. use of both qualitative and quantitative measures; recording what has changed and what has been learnt; the appropriateness and usefulness of the success metrics used).\n* The quality & quantity of reports, articles, media, workshops and tools for both quantitative audit measures (performance, achievements, financials, number of onboarded developers, number of commits in funded proposal repositories (Github), indicators of transactions, volume and unique wallets interacting with dApps; number of smart contracts audited; and social media engagement indicators) and qualitative audit measures (return on intention; narrative evaluation; experimental reporting; community engagement levels as reported by participants)\n* Numbers of auditability training & education sessions, courses, workshops, presentations and learning resources produced by proposals funded in this Challenge; levels of engagement with these; levels of satisfaction reported by users of these.\n\n \n\nOversight of governance\n\n* The quality & quantity of approaches proposed in this Challenge for overseeing governance changes.\n* The degree of variety & innovation demonstrated in the oversight of governance changes.\n* Numbers of people in the community engaging with oversight of governance changes as a result of proposals in this Challenge\n* The appropriateness, scalability and sustainability of governance oversight approaches funded in this Challenge\n* The quality & quantity of reports, articles, media, workshops and tools about Catalyst parameter changes; Voting systems; Community collaboration, communication & notification; and Governance training & education.\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":1043,"proposal_id":"397146","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"PeopleCert DevOps Pilot on Cardano","proposal_summary":"Cardano is seeking significant partners for Atala PRISM.

AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) starts direct mailings to individuals at around age 55 but most retirement is somewhere in the 60-70  years.\n\nAccording to UN research the Senior population is set to double in the next decade. Also, a number of studies indicate that worldwide Seniors hold or control a large amount of money.\n\nTypically, Seniors tend to be more conservatively invested and often by advised by a paid advisor. Most seniors arguably are not in the DeFi market.\n\nThat may be for several reasons including: lack of exposure to DeFi, no educational outreach, fear, ignorance, no incentive to financial advisors, no hand holding platforms that many are used to in the CEX ecosystem and largely because there has been no real incentive to target the Senior market.\n\nIt is important for Cardano to attract the Senior market. It is important to be at the leader position in doing so. Seniors typically park their liquid investments. The influx of Seniors liquidity and long term Staking of Senior money could help lift the ADA investing community.\n\nBy being at the leader position Cardano can position itself to the Worldwide Senior niche as the safe DeFi investments. One that is based on research, science and plodding scaling all in order to be safe. Most seniors like the concept of safe and are typically-Risk Adverse.\n\nPotentially, the Ukrainian invasion has started a dialogue that will resonate with the world regarding Cryptocurriencies. This dialogue should involve all age groups including seniors. It may emphasize how The DeFi world was able to help support a beleaguered community when traditional fiat failed.\n\nThis Challenge is the start to bringing a new subset of Worldwide investors into the Cardano ecosystem. Attracting Insurers, Wealth Advisors, Bankers, IRA funds and other businesses focused on the Senior market may provide increased liquidity to the network.\n\nFunded challenges for Dapp building, specific to Seniors will begin the process. Reward programs and discount dapps directed at the fixed income crowd will initiate conversations. Special Senior Smart contracts to incentivize clients will have Senior oriented businesses turn to Cardano. Seniors worldwide, from all walks of life, backgrounds and nationality will begin to invest in Cardano because of the Senior specific infrastructure that will be built due to this challenge.","proposal_importance":"Diversity in an ecosystem is critical and Seniors cross all boundries and stereotypes.

Those problem areas could include support for improving or creating tools, coordination, resolving governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n* Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it's needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n* High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlapping or duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it would be a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n* High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n* Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat should contributors report?\n\n  \n\n\n* Progress reports - Contributors will report weekly progress reports on what they have been working on in the community, any blockers they have and anything else they feel is relevant.\n* KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like normal idea focussed proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that keep the community up to date on how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat sort of candidates are most suitable?\n\n  \n\n\n* Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n* Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n* Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n* Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn't start with the perfect solution. You understand the difference between short and long term thinking and how to prioritise what is most important and achievable.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat candidates may be less suitable?\n\n  \n\n\n* Idea focussed - You have a great idea and want to work on it full time. This candidate is less suitable as contributors should not be tied to a single idea. Instead contributors are a collaborative force that helps pull ideas and teams together. This person can make a proposal for their idea if that's where they want to focus their time where contributors could help them instead!\n* Wanting full autonomy and independence - Candidates will need to communicate and collaborate with many community members, ideas and projects regularly.

Guide candidates to add more proof of existing contributions or professional background where necessary.\n* Progress report reviews - Check on execution of reported progress by candidates to ensure it meets the standards and expectations of the community. Flag and report candidates where necessary for wider community review.\n\n  \n\n\nFuture ideas to consider with this category\n\n  \n\n\n* Reputation building - Full time contributors could become a vital part of the Cardano ecosystem where the community could issue credentials or vote on people to help work with them in certain areas. Some examples could be for high impact help in areas such as development, coordination, design or planning.\n* Bonuses - The most impactful contributors could be voted for in a governance process and be given a bonus reward for the impact of their contributions. This could make being a contributor very lucrative and align financial incentives well towards those that make large effort contributions that positively benefit the ecosystem.\n","proposal_importance":"Cardano needs full time contributors to help improve the development ecosystem in Cardano and stake pool ecosystem\n\n","proposal_goal":"Cardano community members solving important problems are funded so they can continue providing high impact\n\n","proposal_metrics":"Tracking success for this category will mean:\n\n  \n\n\n* Number of contributions to support Catalyst - Code commits, events organised, coordination support between teams, documentation improvements etc\n* Community support - Conversations with existing development projects and community members and any contributions that help support them\n\n  \n\n\nPart of tracking success for contributors will include improving the reporting and understanding of what a given contributor has worked on to support the ecosystem whilst they have been funded.

as any community, Catalyst, the larger Cardano community, and the blockchain space overall are full of apparent and acute, but also simmering or hidden conflicts.\n\n\n\nConflicts are not inherently bad, as they present opportunities for growth and increased understanding between disputing parties. However, for these positives to manifest, conflict has to be properly transformed. As it has been increasingly made apparent, so far, we are not doing a great job overall as a community in breaking down the barriers that keep sub-communities apart. This situation has already led to community members reducing their involvement with Catalyst or turning their backs on Cardano altogether.\n\n\n\nThe key question then is how do we end something destructive and build something desired.\n\n\n\nWhile the purpose is to promote constructive change processes that may offer immediate solutions, the focus is on building strong relationships within and outside of the Cardano community.\n\n\n\nConflict transformation borrows from indigenous peacemaking, civil rights, and non-violent resistance movements. It influenced restorative justice and is also the base for alternative dispute resolution processes such as narrative and transformative mediation.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Potential directions\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\* Training of conflict transformation specialists (e.g. mediators, facilitators)\n\\* Building and expanding conflict transformation services on Cardano\n\\* Conflict transformation treasury to utilize services at no cost to disputing parties within the Cardano community\n\n\n\n\\*\\*About the proposers\\*\\*\n\n\n\nMatthias Sieber - B.A. Negotiation, Conflict Resolution, and Peace-building, Master of Dispute Resolution, Graduate Certificate in Alternative Dispute Resolution, DRPA-certified mediator, Catalyst Circle v2 member, Cardano StackExchange moderator, Cardano Ambassador, CEO Loxe Inc.\n\n\n\nVictor Corcino - MSc in software development applied to engineering, Specialization in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Catalyst Circle v1 member, Leader of Catalyst School, Co-founder of Catalyst Swarm and Cardano AIM, COO Loxe Inc.\n\n\n\nNori Nishigaya - Founder of the Salmon Nation Decentralized Alliance (SANADA), Bridge Builders, and SPO \\[SAMON\\].

However, as other blockchain protocols recognize the potential of crypto in Africa, without concrete sustained action, Cardano risks losing a potential $1 trillion in market share of the African market to other blockchains within the next 3 years.\n\n  \n\n\n* Africa's crypto market has grown by $105 billion in the last year (2020-2021). Africa is the next crypto frontier- World Economic Forum\n* Alameda Research, Coinbase Ventures, Cadenza, CMT Digital, Distributed Global, GSR, Third Prime and Avon Ventures: African Crypto Exchange VALR Raises $50M in Series B Led by Pantera Capital: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/01/african-crypto-exchange-valr-raises-50m-in-series-b-led-by-pantera-capital/\n\n  \n\n\nIn Catalyst Fund7 the combined Africa funded projects amount was almost negligible compared to those from western and developed economies. https://twitter.com/danny\\_cryptofay/status/1496078645319933954?s=20&t=Ohr06EIZW05vz\\_B4Fjk\\_JA\n\n  \n\n\nThis needs to be reversed through intentional action. Otherwise smaller and smaller portions of Catalyst funding will continue to be allocated to projects focused on African and other emerging economies due to endemic barriers.\n\n  \n\n\n\"*Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win, because they get the signal of support from our community. Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment for mass adoption anywhere. Focusing on Africa is a strategy that has often been promoted and is openly pursued by IOG and Charles Hoskinson.* *The ROI is likely to be high because community sponsored projects are better run in young and developing economies.\"* Greg Bell; (originator of the Grow Cardano series)\n\n","proposal_importance":"We need to look at the fundamentals that are preventing Africa from being a Cardano adoption leader, rather than a perpetual follower.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Practical innovations offered on tackling the unique challenges faced by the continent.

Demand is growing for this category and we are only at the beginning of what is possible with a network of Cardano hubs globally. The network effect will take hold at some point and when it does, we need to be ready with templates, guides and materials on creating and sustaining a new Cardano Community Hub (CCH).\n2. The impact is real and ROI is being met. Real lives are being affected and improved through this category. This creates a win-win, positive feedback loop as more people benefit from the solutions we offer them, there is even more demand for these services worldwide.\n\n  \n\n\nWhile we are Scaling UP community hubs, we need to Scale DOWN individual capital outlay, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.\n\n  \n\n\n1. Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access.\n2. Ensuring resilience and self-reliance within that community.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location.\n\n  \n\n\nIn other words, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it's location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this said, a focus more on 'minimum-viable hubs' (MVHs) is needed. What is the smallest effective unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.\n\n  \n\n\nHow is the Fund 9 challenge different?\n\n  \n\n\nIn addition to the previous rounds challenge goals, this round will introduce the additional components of tooling, measurement and support for hubs. \n\n  \n\n\n* The question is: How do we ensure that community hubs are optimizing and scaling efficiently?\n* The answer is: By providing documentation around best practices, building tools that support growth and tracking performance across the global hub network.\n\n  \n\n\nIn this way, not only is the network of hubs growing with each challenge, but the introduction of supporting frameworks and tools allows them to scale efficiently.\n\n  \n\n\nSupporting partners:\n\n  \n\n\nFor Cardano to achieve its ambition of being a global financial and social infrastructure that banks the unbanked, solves wicked problems and pushes for a more connected, transparent and fair configuration for both the flow of ideas and value, collaborating for the greater good is key, as outlined by SDG 17, Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.\n\n  \n\n\nDuring Fund 6, a community challenge category supported such endeavors, entitled Partnerships for Global Adoption - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26114/stage/all/ideas/unspecified\n\n  \n\n\nCardano stands out in the marketplace of ideas, as a blockchain for good, enabling, equipping and empowering blockchangers to solve local, and global problems, helping to build a more equitable, prosperous world for all. The time has come for the Cardano community to scale up in connecting grassroots led hubs within a decentralized impact network, to multinational, multilateral institutions, for greater collective intelligence and positive social and environmental impact.\n\n  \n\n\nIn that spirit, supporting partners have rallied, met the call, and are keen to join forces to collaborate with Project Catalyst to scale up our Community Hubs:\n\n  \n\n\n* The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 independent and equal countries. It is home to 2.5 billion people, and includes both advanced economies and developing countries. 32 of our members are small states, including many island nations. Member governments have agreed to shared goals like development, democracy and peace. Their values and principles are expressed in the Commonwealth Charter. The Commonwealth's roots go back to the British Empire. But today any country can join the modern Commonwealth. The last country to join the Commonwealth was Rwanda in 2009. https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us.\n\n  \n\n\n* The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)  is the most inclusive intergovernmental platform in the Asia-Pacific region. The Commission promotes cooperation among its 53 member States and 9 associate members in pursuit of solutions to sustainable development challenges. ESCAP is one of the five regional commissions of the United Nations. The ESCAP secretariat supports inclusive, resilient and sustainable development in the region by generating action-oriented knowledge, and by providing technical assistance and capacity-building services in support of national development objectives, regional agreements and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ESCAP also provides support to partners at the national level. ESCAPs national offer is rooted in and linked with the implementation of global and regional intergovernmental frameworks, agreements, and other instruments. The outline of the ESCAPs Offer of Support at the national level is available here. ESCAP pursues this objective by carrying out work, in close cooperation with other United Nations entities and intergovernmental organizations in the region. https://www.unescap.org/our-work\n\n  \n\n\n* Accelerate 2030, initiated by UNDP and Impact Hub, is the worlds largest program supporting entrepreneurs from developing and emerging markets to scale their solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They leverage the strengths and reach of the global Impact Hub network, United Nations organizations, corporates, investors and expert partners to scale entrepreneurial innovations while contributing to a shift towards a more sustainable economy. Operating in hubs across 20+ locations, Accelerate2030 provides one-of-a-kind scaling support to entrepreneurs through National Scale-Ready Programs across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, followed by a Global Scaling Program for those with the highest international scaling potential. https://accelerate2030.net/.\n\n  \n\n\n* One Million Mentors (1MM) is a unique, community-based mentoring project with one simple aim: to connect one million young people with one million life-changing opportunities. This is even more important right now given the impact of COVID-19 on young people. We back the talents of young people to improve their career chances, while at the same time strengthening local communities. 1MM was founded on the belief that through personal, one-to-one mentoring, more young people can grow the knowledge, networks, skills and confidence they need to succeed. By giving them online access to a trained mentor every young person in the country can have the chance to reach their potential. Together we are meeting the challenge and creating social change, on a national scale. https://onemillionmentors.org.uk/about-1mm/\n\n  \n\n\nDue to the scope of the challenge, the proven demand for its place on the regular roster and the large institutional partners who have broadcasted interest in participating on a scale previously unseen by Catalyst and the Scale-Up Hubs community, we are now requesting a 3x budget from the last round.\n\n  \n\n\nAdditional Success Metrics:\n\n  \n\n\nHubs:\n\n  \n\n\n* Is the hub's Fund 9 proposal in keeping with the MVH principle?\n* Do they have an understanding of their target audience?\n* Can they accurately project their reach (physical and online)?\n* Can they accurately project the number of onboarded members to the hub?\n* Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?\n* Have they given an indication of budget costs vs 'cost to launch'? (eg. A CTH may only apply for 1/5 of their cost to launch due to the demand pressures of acquiring catalyst funding)\n\n  \n\n\nTools & Frameworks:\n\n  \n\n\n* Can this tool or framework apply generally across all hubs?\n* Does this business framework have past case studies of successful implementation?\n* Does this online tool require a license fee or is it an open standard?\n* Does it include analytics and performance measurement?\n* Do the tools or frameworks integrate well with the existing hub services?\n\n  \n\n\nRatings by CAs and Voters should favour:\n\n  \n\n\n* Proposals that offer online tools that will support the global hub network.\n* Proposals that offer professional services to the global hub network.\n* Proposals that offer documentation and business frameworks to the global hub network.\n* Proposals that catalyze growth and employment opportunities in their local communities.\n* Proposals that account for local needs and infrastructure concerns.\n* Proposals that show creativity and ingenuity around hub design and information delivery.\n* Proposals that are using local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainability practices.\n\n  \n\n\n---------------\n\n  \n\n\nLet's build an ecosystem that is truly global, allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, whatever level they are starting from.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen you drive adoption at the ground level, you are doing more than just 'building cool products', you are empowering people to change their lives in ways they could have never imagined by themselves.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zK5ralU\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/feXUVDF\n\n  \n\n\nExtra resources:\n\n  \n\n\n* Cumbria, UK Business Hub: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sellafield-invests-26m-to-create-cumbria-business-hub\n* Rwanda Business Hub: https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/norrsken-foundations-hub-opens-in-rwanda-to-house-1000-entrepreneurs-by-next-year\n\n  \n\n\nPast-funded challenges:\n\n  \n\n\n* Scale-UP Community Hubs (F7)\n* Scale-UP Community Hubs (F6)\n* Scale-UP Community Hubs (F5)\n\n  \n\n\n-------------\n\n  \n\n\n*Interested in shaping the next-generation of blockchain innovation centers?* Join the conversation at https://t.me/ScaleUpHubs\n\n","proposal_importance":"With dozens of community hubs now funded, we need a more sophisticated approach to scaling that includes documentation, tooling and support.\n\n","proposal_goal":"Local Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding\n\n","proposal_metrics":"* How many new hubs were launched in 2022?\n* How many countries have at least one community hub?\n* How many new tools were created to support the global hub network?\n* How many hubs improved their processes by applying the frameworks and tools offered?\n* How many developers did this challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\n* How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?\n* How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\n","challenge_type":"community-choice"},{"internal_id":1123,"proposal_id":"396560","proposal_category":{"category_id":"","category_name":"Fund 8","category_description":""},"proposal_title":"American USDC think tank","proposal_summary":"There is a need for more perspectives to be involved in the conversations surrounding the design and implementation of the American USDC.\n\n","proposal_public_key":"9GeC4NyjNLC/oPMMWD4tDuobJTxpS3R+roXfkDmHLIU=","proposal_funds":30000,"proposal_url":"https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBuj9","proposal_files_url":"","proposal_impact_score":195,"proposer":{"proposer_name":"Clear Contracts","proposer_email":"","proposer_url":"","proposer_relevant_experience":"I live in Washington D.C. and go to conferences often.
